## The Logwatcher

![About the Zenit](/assets/img/ThreatHunter-Chronicles-Person.png){: width="700"}

My name is **David Lilja** and I'm a seasoned cybersecurity expert with nearly 30 years in IT, spanning infrastructure, software development, and security leadership. At Truesec's SOC, I help defend organisations across critical sectors through threat hunting and incident response. I'm also part of the extended CSIRT and a regular speaker at security events.

When not parsing logs or hunting threats, I'm a music composer — and occasionally scores Truesec’s videos and summit intros.

The ThreatHunter Chronicles is my outlet for deep-diving and researching different topics. It's basically just a blog about learning more things, and teaching along the way.

☕️ I like coffee, if it wasn't obvious.
