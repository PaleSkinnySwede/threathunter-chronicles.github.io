*Finding your inner join in a leftouter world.*

## Introduction
At the summit of signal and noise lies the Logwatcher’s Zenit, a quiet place for analysts who squint at timestamps and whisper to correlation engines. Bring your coffee, leave your assumptions at home, and why come alone?

## The Fog of Query
Somewhere between your fifth cup of coffee and the fourth attempt at making `summarize` do something useful, it hits you: **KQL is deceptively simple**. You write a few lines, get some rows back, and suddenly you’re riding high on the wave of insight.

Until… it breaks.

> “Why is my result empty?”
> “Why did this join create 400,000 rows?”
> “Why does this chart look like a haunted barcode?”

Fear not, fellow signal-seeker. Every hunter has tripped on these same twigs in the dark forest of logland. Let us confess, forgive, and learn. Here are seven common missteps and how to avoid them.

---

## 🪞 1. Projecting Too Much (Or Too Little)

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| project *
```

The KQL version of grabbing every dish at the buffet. Often used out of habit or panic. And while it seems harmless, `project *` brings in every column, including long dynamic fields, which can clutter your results, ruin visuals, and make you miss the important bits.

✅ Do This Instead:

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| project Timestamp=TimeGenerated, AccountName, LogonType, DeviceName
```

Pick what you need. Let your query breathe and add them in an order that actually tells a story.

---

## 🌀 2. `summarize` Without Direction

```kql
SigninLogs
| summarize count()
```

It returns a single row. Powerful… but mostly meaningless. Summarize is only interesting with context, what are you grouping by? What are you counting?

✅ Use `summarize` With Purpose:

```kql
SigninLogs
| where ResultType == 50074
| summarize FailedLogins = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), UserPrincipalName
```

Add a `bin()` . Add dimensions. Add clarity. Don’t just count. I talked about this in ![this blog post](https://threathunter-chronicles.com/blog/logwatchers-zenit/histogram-the-weight-measurement-of-logs.html); “Histogram, the Weight Measurement of Logs”.

---

## 🕰️ 3. Forgetting Time Exists

```kql
Heartbeat
| summarize count() by Computer
```

No time filter? Welcome to the Land of Empty Results or Eternal Slowness.

✅ Always Respect the Clock:

```kql
Heartbeat
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| summarize count() by Computer
```

Time is not just a column. It’s the backbone of every hunt.

---

## 🔍 4. Using == for Everything
```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where RemoteUrl == "threathunter-chronicles"
```

String filters trip up many. == expects an exact match and logs are rarely that clean.

✅ Prefer Flexible Operators:

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where RemoteUrl has "threathunter-chronicles"
```

Use `has`, `contains`, or even `matches regex` when dealing with noisy, unstructured data.

---

## 📦 5. Ignoring Dynamic Data

```kql
AzureDiagnostics
| project Properties.SomeNestedField
```

This fails unless `Properties` is already parsed. And no, KQL won’t do it for you.

✅ Know Thy `parse_json()`:

```kql
AzureDiagnostics
| extend props = parse_json(Properties)
| project props.SomeNestedField
```

Dynamic fields are like onions. You’ve got to peel them.

---

## 🧩 6. Joining Without Guardrails

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| join kind=inner (IdentityInfo) on AccountName
```

And suddenly, you have 14 million rows. Joins are powerful but dangerous without a primary key strategy.

✅ Use Clean Keys and Joins That Make Sense:

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| summarize LastSeen=max(TimeGenerated) by AccountName
| join kind=inner (
    IdentityInfo
    | summarize LastInfo=max(TimeGenerated) by AccountName
  ) on AccountName
```

Think about cardinality. Are you joining 1:1 or 1:many? Use `kind=leftouter` to keep your base table intact.

---

## 🧠 7. Thinking It’s Just SQL
`SELECT * FROM SecurityEvent WHERE EventID = 4625;`

Nope.

KQL isn’t SQL. It’s built for log streams, not relational databases. Learn to think in *pipes*, not nested queries. KQL isn’t about tables. It’s about signal transformation.

---

## 🎓 Final Thoughts from the Zenit
Every query is a meditation.

It teaches you not just about the data, but about *how you think*. KQL invites curiosity, iteration, and when the results are just right, a small flicker of joy.

You’ll mess up joins. You’ll overproject. You’ll forget `bin()`. We all do. Trust me. But you’ll learn.

> But the true hunter learns. Not just from success, but from every failed query that whispered, “Almost.”

#### 🧪 Bonus Challenge — Can You Fix This Query?
Here’s one I’ve seen in the wild. Can you spot and fix the issues? It’s an easy one.

```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == "4625" or EventID == "4624"
| summarize count() by Account, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where Account != ""
```

Drop your fix in the comments and tell me why.

#### 🙏 Thanks for Reading
Got your own KQL sins to confess? Or maybe some lessons from the trenches? Share them with me, this Zenit has room for all Logwatchers.

Until next time: bin your timestamps, parse your JSON, and always bring snacks and coffee to the incident call. May your joins be inner.
