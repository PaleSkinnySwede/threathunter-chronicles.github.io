At the summit of signal and noise lies the _Logwatcher’s Zenit_ — a quiet place for analysts who squint at timestamps and whisper to correlation engines. This category explores log analysis, data parsing, and threat hunting with a touch of [KQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/?view=microsoft-fabric&wt.mc_id=MVP_387063), a dash of [XDR](https://www.microsoft.com/sv-se/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-xdr/?wt.mc_id=MVP_387063), and the occasional existential crisis about why that one alert keeps firing every Friday afternoon 5 minutes before you’re about to clock out.

Expect practical queries, musings on telemetry, and maybe even a few moments of enlightenment between the joins and the let-statements. Bring your coffee, leave your assumptions at home and make sure your wireless mouse and keyboard are fully charged.
