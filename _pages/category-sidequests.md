Some adventures begin with a stray command, a corrupted ISO, or an innocent ‘what if?’ at 2AM. Side Quests is where we document the glorious tangents: the odd tools, offbeat projects, and unsolicited technical revelations that make life worth scripting. No XP guaranteed, but an adventure more enlightening than the main plot. Loot optional.
